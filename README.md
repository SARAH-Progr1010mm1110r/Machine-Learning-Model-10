# Machine-Learning-Model-10
## **Deploy a machine learning model**

# **Milestone 1**


1. Read the garments_worker_productivity.csv data.

2. Perform exploratory data analysis, feature selection/engineering and train your model.

3. Choose either a regression model or classification model, depending on your chosen target feature.

4. Use any ML algorithm for your model, try at least 2 ML algorithms and choose the one that performs best.

5. Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning of your model.

6. Save your model using a pickle file. If you used any encoder (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, etc.) for features or scaler (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, etc.) you need to save them too.

# **Milestone 2**
7. After saving the model,start web application. use any text editor for this purpose (PyCharm, VScode, Sublime, etc.)

8. All HTML files go into the folder "templates", all CSS files go into the folder "static".

9. Create a virtual environment and install Flask.

10. In the app.py file, implement the .predict method to make it functional for predictions.
